Thanks for your purchase! 

These photos where taken in Warren New Hampshire, with a 50MP camera.
 
I am including few different resolutions and color depths for use as backgrounds on older systems (starting with windows 95)
if you are running a newer operating system on old hardware, I recommend the normal HD version as it will use less RAM.

KEY:
IMAGENAME_W95 - 640x480 resolution | 16 colors
IMAGENAME_WXP - 640x480 resolution | 256 colors (works in Windows 98 with 8 bit color mode)
IMAGENAME_HD - 1920x1080 resolution | 16.777 million colors
IMAGENAME_UHD - 3085x1739+ resolution | 16.777 million colors
